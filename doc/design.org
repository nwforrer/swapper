* Swapper

You are a forest spirit that has been spurned by the creatures you protect. It's time for revenge.

** Core mechanics

You start the game with the ability to take over an enemies body. When you do, you gain their abilities and attributes. 
You retain your ability to take over bodies, and when using this while inside another body, you will swap bodies. Your old body will then become another enemy.
You can only maintain control of a body for a limited number of turns. The more powerful the body, the fewer number of turns you can control it. 
When you've lost control of the body, you are banished to the spirit realm and must begin again.
